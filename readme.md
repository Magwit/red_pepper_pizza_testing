# Red Pepper Pizza Test 

## A portfolio within a portfolio

The opportunity when testing a site I built myself is that it allows for designing the test around the error and make decisions around how to best ways to handle the error.

The goals for this project is the follwing:

- Build a test that uses selenium to simulate more elaborate user actions when iteractin g with a pizza ordering site
- Have the test find a known error and capture a screenshot
